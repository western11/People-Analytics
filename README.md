# People-Analytics
People Analytics is vast and sometimes confusing task to do because people action is mostly unpredictable. Lots of subjective approach to consider but it doesn't mean we can't predict human behaviour using historical data. People analytics, especially in Human Resource Management area, is revolutionising the way human resources departments operate, leading to higher efficiency and better results overall. Rather than using traditional methods, we can use machine learning method to the game and identifying which employees are most likely will leave the company so the HR will have enough time to do precautionary measure. Our analysis will be their first signal, so the company needs your help in doing such analysis with accurate and interpretable methods.
